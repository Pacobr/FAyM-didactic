Run the calculation. The settings panel that will show up after running for the first time allows you to select the potential and all the parameters necessary to solve the Schrödinger equation using Neronov's method. Some parameters come with fixed values depending on the chosen potential. You can customize your values by dragging the control rule or inputting a specific value in the corresponding field to the right of the control rule. After modifying any parameter, a figure appears with the solution to the Schrödinger equation. This figure is updated every time a parameter is modified with the slider. **If the parameter is modified inputing a specific numerical value, one must press ENTER to trigger the a new calculation.** Also, the chart itself has controls to move the axes, zoom, etc.\n","\n","3.
